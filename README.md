# Project Template
Reusable base architecture for building modular technical systems such as robotics, automation, trading, sensor processing, and advanced analytics pipelines.
---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
This template enforces a **clear separation of concerns** and a **layered system architecture**, enabling:
* Scalability across domains (trading, radar, robotics, etc.)
* Reusability of core components
* Clean integration of mathematical models and machine learning
* Easy transition from local development to cloud deployment
The goal is to provide a **system-level blueprint**, not just a code structure.
---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview
The system follows a **layered pipeline architecture** with supporting computational modules.

```
### 🔹 Core Flow
* **Input → Processing → Classification → Output**
  Represents the main data flow:

  * Data is acquired from external sources (`input`)
  * Transformed and prepared (`processing`)
  * Interpreted or labeled (`classification`)
  * Persisted or exposed (`output`)
---
### 🔹 Supporting Layer (Processing Core)
The `processing` layer is supported by specialized modules:
* **ETL**
  * Data extraction, transformation, normalization
  * Data alignment and preparation
* **Math**
  * Domain-specific mathematical operations
  * Signal processing, transformations, numerical methods
* **Models**
  * Statistical or machine learning models
  * Inference and scoring logic
  * Mathemathical models of specific dynamic
* **Control**
  * Control logic and feedback systems
  * Decision loops or dynamic adjustments
These components are not standalone pipeline stages, but **internal capabilities used by the processing layer**.
---
### 🔹 Architectural Principles
* **Separation of concerns**
  Each module has a single responsibility
* **Processing-centric design**
  The system is built around a strong transformation layer
* **Extensibility**
  New models, math modules, or control strategies can be added without affecting the pipeline
* **Domain independence**
  The same architecture applies to trading, robotics, signal processing, and automation systems
---
### 🔹 Orchestration
The entire system is orchestrated by the `main` module, which:
* Coordinates execution order
* Connects all modules
* Defines the pipeline lifecycle
---
This structure enables building **scalable, real-time, and cloud-ready systems** while maintaining clean modular boundaries.
